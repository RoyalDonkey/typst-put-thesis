The quadratic equation, as seen on @eq:quadratic.

$
	x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4 a c)) / (2 a)
$ <eq:quadratic>

=== Eloquent work E <sec:work-e>
#lorem(170)

The arc length of a continuous function can be calculated using @eq:arc-length.

$
	S = integral_a^b sqrt(1 + (f'(x))^2) dif x
$ <eq:arc-length>

=== Frenetic work F
Unlike @sec:work-e, work F was quite frenetic and, frankly, less
methodologically sound. Nevertheless, through the authors' unrelenting
stubbornness, it yielded interesting results that pushed the state of knowledge
in the field forward.
