# put-thesis-typst

An unofficial Typst template for writing a thesis for Poznań University of
Technology. Based on
[the LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/put-dissertation-template/dpqxdndmgkpg)
by Dawid Weiss, Marta Szachniuk and Maciej Komosiński (2022), as well as
[the official guidelines](https://fee.put.poznan.pl/sites/default/files/2022-02/Wytyczne%20na%20temat%20pisania%20prac%20dyplomowych.pdf)
for writing such theses in PUT (2022).

The template supports Bachelor's and Master's theses, in Polish or English. It
was adapted from a template for the faculty of Computing and Telecommunications
(WIiT), but the subcaption can be adjusted for any faculty.
